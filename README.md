# BRAINNET-TRANSFER-ML-MODEL---HEMORRHAGE-DETECTION-
Employed transfer learning with the AlexNet architecture, leveraging pre-trained weights on ImageNet, and fine-tuned the model on the brain hemorrhage dataset consisting of 45,000 images

In this research, the detection of brain hemorrhage in CT images problem is solved using neural networks and the results sound robust and promising. One of the motivations behind this research is to address and attempt to overcome the difficulties that radiologists might encounter when diagnosing brain hemorrhage suspected images. Hence, we investigated the use of a potential deep convolutional neural network that can help medical experts in making more accurate decisions. As a result, this may reduce the diagnosis error and boost the accuracy of hemorrhage identification made by medical experts. 
The pre-trained modified network “AlexNet-SVM” for the same classification task. The three models including the proposed model were trained on a relatively small database in order to examine the network performance. It is obvious that the application of deep learning networks in medical image analysis encounters several challenges. The challenge is the lack of large training data sets which can be considered as an obstacle. The experiments conducted demonstrate that the transfer of knowledge into medical images can be possible, even though the deep networks are originally trained on natural images. 
The proposed model using the SVM classifier helps in improving the performance of AlexNet. Moreover, it was manifested that a small number of data can be enough for fine-tuning a pre-trained model, in contrast to a CNN created from scratch which needs a large number of data to be trained. Thus, the proposed model’s performance is an indicator of how transfer learning-based networks can be considered in brain hemorrhage identification.
